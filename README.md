CSS Box Model
Description
This project demonstrates the fundamental concept of the CSS Box Model. The CSS Box Model is a layout structure in web development that describes how elements are displayed on a web page. Each HTML element is treated as a rectangular box, consisting of content, padding, border, and margin. Understanding the box model is essential for creating responsive and well-structured layouts.

Components of the Box Model
Content: This is the core area where text, images, or other media elements are displayed.
Padding: The space around the content inside the border. It adds extra space between the content and the border, making the content area look larger.
Border: The outline that surrounds the padding and content. Borders can be styled with various colors, thicknesses, and patterns.
Margin: The space outside the border that separates an element from other elements. Margins create spacing between boxes on a page.
